I modified my portfolio site to use some 3rd party JavaScript to perform some usefl tasks.  
I included Google Analytics for tracking.  
This is beneficial on my end because I can track all the content that receives views and shares.  
I could use this information to make my website more appealing to specific audience.  
I included them in crud.html, customdialog.html, index.html, nativedialogs.html, and styledcrud.html.    
Also, I updated my Project Section of my personal website.  
I included all the projects and its source code.  
In the future, I will include Live Demo as well.
